# Neetcode-Roadmap

This repository contains my solutions to the NeetCode [Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap), a curated path for mastering data structures, algorithms, and coding interview skills. Each solution is organized by topic.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is structured by topics, each corresponding to a section in the NeetCode roadmap:

- **Arrays & Hashing**
- **Two Pointers**
- **Sliding Window**
- **Binary Search**
- **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **...and more**

Each folder contains solutions to specific problems within that topic, with filenames indicating the problem title or number. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any solution, ensure you have Python (or the required language) installed. Solutions are designed to be modular, so you can directly execute them or use them as references for similar problems.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/neetcode-roadmap-solutions.git
   cd neetcode-roadmap-solutions
   ```

2. **Run a Solution**
   Navigate to the relevant folder and execute the solution file:
   ```bash
   python arrays-hashing/problem_name.py
   ```

## 📘 Problem-Solving Approach

Each solution includes a:
- **Problem Summary** - Brief description and constraints.
- **Solution Approach** - Explanation of the chosen algorithm and data structure.
- **Complexity Analysis** - Time and space complexity of the solution.

## 📝 Progress

Tracking my progress on the roadmap, with updates as I tackle new challenges and refine existing solutions.
